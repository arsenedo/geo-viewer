# GEO VIEWER MVP

## Getting started
- First of all you need to have nodejs on your machine

- Next step is running the webapp, to do it, you need to run the following commands

```bash
> npm i

> npm run dev
```

If the build process was successful, you should see a URL in the terminal. Usually it's pointed to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

A build was done on vercel, you can find it at [geo-viewer-lyart.vercel.app](https://geo-viewer-lyart.vercel.app/)
